- Implemented and optimized a dataset visualization tool, ensuring a clear and comprehensive understanding of the data scenarios
- Explored suitable algorithms for classifying the dataset such as straight driving, deceleration, lane changing, and turning. into distinct categories with a high degree of accuracy

**Electrical Engineer Intern @ Galileo Innovations (GI) Pvt. Ltd (_06/2022 - 08/2022_)**
- Developed a cooling system using Peltier effect for a smart wearable thermoregulatory device
- Simulated the cooling model via MATLAB to determine the temperatures within the system and test the performance of the cooling system under different conditions
- Built the demo circuit by Arduino and applied a genetic algorithm based on optimization to find the optimal value of the supplied electrical current for thermoelectric cooling module

## Projects
### Autonomous Window Frame Installation Tracking for Construction Sites

Led the development of an autonomous tracking system for construction sites using LiDAR-enabled footed robots, enabling real-time exploration and mapping. Integrated a pre-trained YOLO model to detect and mark window frames by fusing camera and LiDAR data for accurate localization. Leveraged ROS for real-time communication to record point cloud maps and bounding boxes, and implemented a progress-tracking feature to monitor and report on installation stages, enhancing project oversight and precision.

### Design of Golf Ball Collecting Robot and Its Control Strategies
Designed and developed an autonomous golf ball-collecting robot with a C++-based navigation system, utilizing the A* algorithm for efficient path planning by segmenting the floor and avoiding obstacles. Performed an in-depth analysis of the robot's kinematics and motion control to optimize performance, and validated the robot's robustness and control algorithms through extensive experimentation, ensuring reliable and practical operation.

### Design of Global KPI Dashboard for Workload Optimization Management

Conducted an in-depth analysis of workforce tasks and operational processes, transforming raw data into actionable KPI metrics for effective management. Developed regression-based algorithms and custom queries to monitor and assess order fulfillment performance, providing insights into process health. Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visually track employee workflow and performance, streamlining oversight and decision-making.
