## About me	
Hey there! I'm Shixin, a robotics engineer who loves making machines do cool stuff. It all started when my dad brought home our first robot vacuum â€“ watching it navigate around furniture got me hooked on the idea of building smarter robots.
Outside of tinkering with robots, I'm an avid climber who enjoys challenging myself on both indoor and outdoor routes. You might also find me in the kitchen, experimenting with new recipes (yes, sometimes they turn out Instagram-worthy, and sometimes... well, let's just say I'm still learning ðŸ˜„). Between climbing sessions and cooking adventures, I keep up with my fitness routine to stay energized.
When it's time to unwind, I dive into video games to explore new virtual worlds. And speaking of worlds, 'Back to the Future' is my all-time favorite sci-fi movie â€“ who wouldn't want a time-traveling DeLorean? Maybe that's my next project... just kidding! (Or am I? ðŸ¤”)
Let's connect and chat about robots, climbing, gaming, or your favorite recipes!

## Projects
### Autonomous Window Frame Installation Tracking for Construction Sites

Led the development of an autonomous tracking system for construction sites using LiDAR-enabled footed robots, enabling real-time exploration and mapping. Integrated a pre-trained YOLO model to detect and mark window frames by fusing camera and LiDAR data for accurate localization. Leveraged ROS for real-time communication to record point cloud maps and bounding boxes, and implemented a progress-tracking feature to monitor and report on installation stages, enhancing project oversight and precision.

### Design of Golf Ball Collecting Robot and Its Control Strategies
Designed and developed an autonomous golf ball-collecting robot with a C++-based navigation system, utilizing the A* algorithm for efficient path planning by segmenting the floor and avoiding obstacles. Performed an in-depth analysis of the robot's kinematics and motion control to optimize performance, and validated the robot's robustness and control algorithms through extensive experimentation, ensuring reliable and practical operation.

### Design of Global KPI Dashboard for Workload Optimization Management

Conducted an in-depth analysis of workforce tasks and operational processes, transforming raw data into actionable KPI metrics for effective management. Developed regression-based algorithms and custom queries to monitor and assess order fulfillment performance, providing insights into process health. Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visually track employee workflow and performance, streamlining oversight and decision-making.

### Wheel Loader Path Planning with Terrain Traversability

Navigating a simplified wheel loader model through a series of pointsâ€”starting, digging, and loadingâ€”inside a custom-simulated environment. While disregarding the robot's kinematics and articulated joints, the simulation is focusing on achieving precise robot poses at critical junctures using Dubinâ€™s curves. The integrated RRT*(Rapidly-exploring Random Trees Star) algorithm is facilitating the exploration and generation of an optimal curved path in an unknown space with traversable and non-traversable region. Preliminary results are demonstrating the potential of combining these techniques to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of autonomous path planning in complex environments.
